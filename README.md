# ClassProjectinBaseR
This is a class project written in Base R for CS544 at Boston University
It briefly analyzes data regarding undergraduate college majors and 
their income progression via starting salary and mid-career salary(10-15 years out)
Really more of an exercise in using broad functions in R such as sampling, linear regression, plotting and working with data types

And yes, this could look a lot better if it was written using Tidyverse, but the class was mostly focused on Base R.
