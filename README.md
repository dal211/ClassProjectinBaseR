# ClassProjectinR
This is a class project written in Base R for CS544 at Boston University
It briefly analyzes data regarding undergraduate college majors and 
their income progression via starting salary and mid-career salary(10-15 years out)
Really more of an exercise in using broad functions in R such as sampling, linear regression, plotting and working with data types

7/26/19 - I'm working to rewrite this in dplyr(because it's much better)
