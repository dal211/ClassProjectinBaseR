# ClassProjectinR
This is a class project written in R for CS544 at Boston University
It briefly analyzes data regarding undergraduate college majors and 
their income progression via starting salary and mid-career salary(10-15 years out)

I try to use Tidyverse/Dplyr/ggplot2 as much as I can

These are the topics I cover:

1. Preparing the Data
2. Categorical Variables
3. Numerical Variables
4. Distribution of data
5. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) - Demonstrating the CLT using n trials and k samples of the mid-career income variable
6. Sampling Methods - Comparing various sampling methods and how their characteristics compare to the “population” dataset 
7. Simple Linear Regression - Relationship of starting salary predicting mid-career salary
